    <description>
Eigen provided for use in Windows projects.

This package is inspired from https://github.com/nuclearsandwich/eigen-choco and https://github.com/ros2/choco-packages, with minor modifications. It does not currently provide the unsupported Eigen files. Nor does it use the CMake-native installer from upstream which appears to rely on the `make` utility.

Eigen is Free Software. Starting from the 3.1.1 version, it is licensed under the MPL2, which is a simple weak copyleft license. Common questions about the MPL2 are answered in the official MPL2 FAQ.
Earlier versions were licensed under the LGPL3+.
Note that currently, a few features rely on third-party code licensed under the LGPL: SimplicialCholesky, AMD ordering, and constrained_cg. Such features can be explicitly disabled by compiling with the EIGEN_MPL2_ONLY preprocessor symbol defined. Furthermore, Eigen provides interface classes for various third-party libraries (usually recognizable by the &lt;Eigen/*Support&gt; header name). Of course you have to mind the license of the so-included library when using them.
Virtually any software may use Eigen. For example, closed-source software may use Eigen without having to disclose its own source code. Many proprietary and closed-source software projects are using Eigen right now, as well as many BSD-licensed projects.
